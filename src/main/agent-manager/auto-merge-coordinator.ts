 * The squash-merge itself is a filesystem operation and cannot be rolled back by
 * SQLite; atomicity is bounded to the DB side. We wrap every DB write that
 * accompanies the status transition in a single better-sqlite3 transaction so a
 * crash between updates cannot leave the task in a half-transitioned state
 * (e.g. status updated but audit trail missing, or vice versa).
 *
 * The audit trail (task_changes) is recorded automatically by `repo.updateTask`
 * via its internal `recordTaskChanges` call, so both writes land under the same
 * transaction scope.
 *
 * If the DB write fails after the merge has already landed on main, we log a
 * loud banner so the on-call operator knows exactly which task needs manual
 * status reconciliation.
