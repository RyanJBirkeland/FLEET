    'NEVER `cd` to an absolute path outside your worktree. Your cwd is already the isolated worktree; every spec path (e.g. `src/main/index.ts`, `src/renderer/src/views/DashboardView.tsx`) resolves correctly from there. An absolute path pointing at `/Users/<anyone>/Projects/git-repos/` bypasses worktree isolation and pollutes the main checkout.',

    'When using Write or Edit tools, prefer paths relative to your worktree. If you use an absolute path, it MUST begin with your worktree path (which starts with `~/worktrees/` or equivalently `/Users/<you>/worktrees/`). An absolute path beginning with `/Users/<you>/Projects/` writes to the main checkout — that is a bug, never do it.'

    'After running pre-commit checks, include the pass/fail summary as the LAST line of your final commit message body: `Verified: typecheck OK, N tests passed, lint 0 errors`'
