  guidance: `# PR Review & Merge

## Check PR Status
\`\`\`bash
gh pr list --state open
gh pr view <number> --json title,state,mergeable,statusCheckRollup
gh pr checks <number>
\`\`\`

## Review Code Changes
\`\`\`bash
gh pr diff <number>
gh pr diff <number> --name-only
\`\`\`

## Resolve Merge Conflicts
1. Create worktree: \`git worktree add ~/.bde/worktrees/rebase-<branch> <branch>\`
2. Rebase: \`cd ~/.bde/worktrees/rebase-<branch> && git rebase origin/main\`
3. Resolve conflicts, then \`git add <file> && git rebase --continue\`
4. For modify/delete conflicts: \`git rm <file>\`
5. Push: \`git push --force-with-lease origin <branch>\`
6. Cleanup: \`git worktree remove ~/.bde/worktrees/rebase-<branch>\`

## Merge Strategies
- **Squash** (default): Combines all commits. Best for feature branches.
- **Merge commit**: Preserves history. Use for large PRs.
- **Rebase**: Linear history. Use when branch is clean.

## BDE Code Review Station
The Code Review Station (Cmd+5) provides diff inspection, commit history, conversation tab, and per-task actions: Ship It (merge + push in one click), Merge Locally, Create PR, Request Revision, Rebase, and Discard. Agent worktrees are preserved for human inspection at \`review\` status.
