# BDE Security Posture

Last updated: 2026-04-03

## Network Surface

BDE has **zero network surface**. No HTTP servers, no open ports, no outbound HTTP calls to external services.

- Queue API (port 18790) removed in PR #613
- Runner client (port 18799) removed in PR #614
- The only network traffic is to the Anthropic API via the Claude Agent SDK (same as Claude Code CLI)

## Comparison: BDE vs Claude Code CLI

### Equivalent

| Concern                 | Claude Code CLI          | BDE                                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Network surface         | None                     | None                               |
| Agent capabilities      | Full file/shell access   | Same — uses the same SDK           |
| Token storage           | `~/.claude/` (plaintext) | `~/.bde/oauth-token` (0600 perms)  |
| Push-to-main prevention | Permission prompts       | Prompt conventions + branch naming |

### Where BDE adds protection

| Concern          | Claude Code CLI              | BDE                                                                             |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Agent isolation  | Runs in your repo directly   | Pipeline agents run in disposable git worktrees                                 |
| Code review      | You review diffs in terminal | Code Review Station UI — structured diff view, commit history, conversation log |
| Task audit trail | None                         | Field-level change tracking in SQLite (`task_changes` table)                    |

### Where BDE has more surface area

| Concern          | Claude Code CLI     | BDE                                                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Electron process | N/A — Node CLI only | Chromium renderer + main process                                          |
| Dependencies     | ~50                 | ~200+ (Electron, Monaco, React, etc.)                                     |
| Local data store | None                | `~/.bde/bde.db` — task specs, agent history (readable by local processes) |
| IPC channels     | None                | 86 typed channels between renderer and main                               |
| Binary signing   | Installed via npm   | Unsigned DMG (Gatekeeper warning)                                         |

### Threat model summary

**"Don't leak data over the network"** — BDE and Claude Code CLI are equivalent. Neither opens ports or sends data anywhere except the Anthropic API.

**Local process compromise** — If an attacker has local access as your user, both tools are equally exposed. BDE stores more data locally (SQLite with task specs and agent history) but none of it is network-accessible.

**Supply chain** — BDE has a larger dependency tree due to Electron/React/Monaco. Dependencies are audited regularly via `npm audit`. As of 2026-04-03: 0 high/critical vulnerabilities, 2 moderate (Monaco's internal DOMPurify — not exploitable in BDE's context).

## Security measures in place

- **Parameterized SQL** — all database queries use prepared statements
- **Argument-array exec** — all shell commands use `execFileAsync(cmd, [args])`, never string interpolation
- **Electron contextIsolation** — renderer cannot access Node APIs directly
- **DOMPurify + iframe sandbox** — playground HTML sanitized before rendering
- **Path traversal prevention** — IDE file handlers and playground handler validate paths against allowed roots using symlink-aware `realpathSync` checks
- **Timing-safe auth comparison** — internal auth uses `timingSafeEqual`
- **Content Security Policy** — production builds restrict script sources to `'self'`
- **GitHub API allowlist** — only specific HTTP methods and fields permitted through the proxy
