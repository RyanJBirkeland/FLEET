Source: `src/renderer/src/components/`

| Module | Group | Purpose | Key Exports |
|--------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `ReviewQueue.tsx` | code-review | Displays tasks awaiting review with keyboard navigation (j/k). Scoped store subscription via `useShallow` to avoid re-renders on unrelated task changes. Select-all checkbox has `aria-label` with task count; visually-hidden `aria-live="polite"` region announces batch selection changes. | `ReviewQueue` |
| `Sidebar.tsx` | layout | Persistent nav sidebar with view badges for review/failed counts. Uses named selectors from sprintTasks store. | `Sidebar` |
| `AgentCard.tsx` | agents | Compact card showing agent status, cost, and duration. Uses `useBackoffInterval` for the live duration ticker. | `AgentCard` |
| `WorkbenchForm.tsx` | task-workbench | Task creation/edit form with AI copilot, dependency picker, and validation checks. Priority and Dependencies are always visible; Advanced section contains cost, model, playground, and cross-repo contract. | `WorkbenchForm` |
| `SpecEditor.tsx` | task-workbench | Spec textarea with template buttons (Feature, Bug Fix, Refactor, Test) sourced from `DEFAULT_TASK_TEMPLATES` in `src/shared/constants.ts`, Generate Spec, Research Codebase, and quality hint indicators. | `SpecEditor` |
| `BatchActionsToolbar.tsx` | code-review | Renders the batch action buttons (Merge All, Ship All, Create PRs, Discard All, Clear) with in-flight spinner state. Extracted from `TopBar` to eliminate JSX duplication. Count span has `aria-live="polite"`; the 4 batch action buttons (Merge All, Ship All, Create PRs, Discard All) each have an `aria-label` that includes the selection count (the Clear button does not). | `BatchActionsToolbar` |
| `ReviewActionsBar.tsx` | code-review | Review action buttons (Ship It, Merge Locally, Create PR, Revise, Discard) plus freshness badge and rebase button. Renders in `full` or `compact` variant (compact uses a render-prop). Ship It button has `aria-busy` and contextual `aria-label` during in-flight state. | `ReviewActionsBar`, `ReviewActionCallbacks` |
| `VirtualizedDiffContent.tsx` | diff | Virtualized rendering of diff rows (file headers, hunk headers, lines). Manages scroll/viewport via ResizeObserver and binary-search visibility window. Exports shared row types (`FlatRow`, `HunkAddress`) and height constants used by `DiffViewer`. | `VirtualizedDiffContent`, `FlatRow`, `HunkAddress`, `rowHeight`, `ROW_HEIGHT`, `FILE_HEADER_HEIGHT`, `HUNK_HEADER_HEIGHT` |
| `VirtualizedDiffBanner.tsx` | diff | Banner shown above large diffs in virtualized mode, with a "Load full diff" button to disable virtualization and enable commenting. | `VirtualizedDiffBanner` |
| `GhStep.tsx` | onboarding | Onboarding step that checks gh CLI availability via `onboarding:checkGhCli` IPC. Shows loading/success/error states. Next button disabled until gh is confirmed available. | `GhStep` |
| `AuthStep.tsx` | onboarding | Onboarding step that checks Claude Code CLI auth via `auth.status` IPC. Shows per-check status icons. Next button disabled while checking or when any prerequisite (cliFound, tokenFound, tokenExpired) is unmet. | `AuthStep` |
| `GitStep.tsx` | onboarding | Onboarding step that checks git availability via `git.getRepoPaths` IPC. Shows check status icon. Next button disabled while checking or when git is unavailable. | `GitStep` |
